- Seperation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems

### O -  Open-Closed Principle
- Classes should be open for extention but clossed for modification

### L - Liskov Substitution Princile
- You should be able to substitute base type for a subtybe

### I - Interface Segregation Principle
- Don't put too much into an interface, split it into separate interfaces
- YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Need It

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle
- High-Level module should not depend upon low-level ones, both shoudl depend on abdtraction/interfaces
